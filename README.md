# Java---Second-Course
To be able to design program components that are changeable, reusable and resource-efficient, good knowledge of both advanced language constructions and programming techniques as well as data abstraction, data structures and algorithms is required. The aim of the course is to provide students with expanded knowledge of object-oriented programming techniques and of a selection of algorithms and data structures suitable for solving common problems. The course will also provide the skills required to understand and utilize modern libraries for object-oriented programming that implement classical data structures and algorithms.
